How to install with NPM 

https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/getting-started/download/

Package managers
Pull in Bootstrap’s source files into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Bootstrap will require a Sass compiler, Autoprefixer, and postcss-flexbugs-fixes for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

npm
Install Bootstrap in your Node powered apps with the npm package:

Copy
npm install bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6
require('bootstrap') will load all of Bootstrap’s jQuery plugins onto the jQuery object. The bootstrap module itself does not export anything. You can manually load Bootstrap’s jQuery plugins individually by loading the /js/*.js files under the package’s top-level directory.

Bootstrap’s package.json contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

sass - path to Bootstrap’s main Sass source file
style - path to Bootstrap’s non-minified CSS that’s been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)
